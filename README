TUTKA
=====

OVERVIEW
========
   Tutka is a free (as in freedom) tracker style MIDI sequencer for
   GNU/Linux (and other systems; only GNU/Linux is supported at this
   time though). It is similar to programs like SoundTracker, ProTracker 
   and FastTracker except that it does not support samples and is meant 
   for MIDI use only. Tutka is licensed under the GNU GPL.

   In Tutka songs are made of blocks. Each block represents a period in
   time. These blocks can be played in any order to form a complete song.
   Blocks are made of tracks on which the notes are placed. All tracks of
   a block are played simultaneously. Only one note can be played on one
   track at a time. Blocks can vary in length and may have different
   number of tracks.

   Each note is played using an instrument. Each instrument can have
   properties such as name, MIDI channel, default volume, hold time and
   so on. Effects can also be applied to notes. In Tutka effects include
   things like volume, aftertouch, pitch bending, note delays, setting
   tempo and so on. MIDI controllers can also be used.

   Tutka uses a custom XML based file format for storing songs. Songs in
   OctaMED SoundStudio's MMD2 file format can also be loaded and saved.

REQUIREMENTS
============
   Tutka is written in C++. Tutka requires Qt >= 4.8.0. For MIDI on GNU/Linux
   Tutka needs ALSA 0.9.0 or later.

NOTES (READ THIS!)
==================
   Even though Tutka has been very stable for quite some time now it is still
   not finished. It may not work, it may lose your work or do other unintended
   things. The author takes no responsibility for any loss of data caused by
   Tutka. See the TODO file for a list of bugs and missing features.
   Please report any bugs you find.

   The file format may change in versions prior to 1.0. Only converter
   scripts will be provided to make it possible to load files saved with
   earlier versions. Earlier versions may not be able to load files saved
   with later versions.

COMMANDS
========
   All MIDI related commands have a command value range from $00 to $7F.
   Values from $80 to $FF can be used for sliding (more information on this
   later).
