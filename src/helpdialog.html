<h1>Tutka</h1>

<h2><a>Usage</a></h2>

<h3 class="nopadding"><a id="blocks">Blocks</a></h3>

<p>
In Tutka songs are made of blocks. These blocks can be played in any order to
form a complete song by placing them in a
<a href="#playingsequence">playing sequence</a>. Blocks can be created and
deleted and their properties can be edited using the Block List window. The
Block List window can be opened by selecting List from the Block menu or by
clicking the Block label in the bottom right part of the main window. The Block
List window can also be used to select the currently visible and editable block.
</p>

<h4>Lines</h4>

<p>
Each block represents a certain period in time - a part of the song. This time
period is further divided into lines that are represented vertically. A block
begins from the top and ends at the bottom. All contents of a line are played
simultaneously. If the playing speed is not varied each line is equal in
length. There may be any number of lines in a block. The number of lines in a
block can be changed using the Block List window.
</p>

<h4>Tracks</h4>

<p>
Horizontally blocks are divided into tracks. Multiple tracks allow multiple
notes on the same line because only one note can be played on one track at a
time. Each track has room for one note and one or more commands on each of the
block's lines. There may be any number of tracks in a block. The number of
tracks in a block can be changed using the Block List window.
</p>

<p>
Each track has a global master volume between 0 (minimum) and 127 (maximum). It
can be used to change the volume of a track in the entire song. Tracks can also
be muted so that their contents will not be played. These settings can be set
using the Track Volumes window. The Track Volumes window can be opened by
selecting Track Volumes from the Song menu.
</p>

<h3><a id="instruments">Instruments</a></h3>

<p>
Each note is played using an instrument. Each instrument can have properties
such as name, MIDI interface, MIDI channel, default volume, hold time and so
on. Instruments are numbered from from 1 to 9 and from A to Z. The currently
active instrument is shown in the top right part of the main window. It is used
when playing or adding notes into blocks using the keyboard. The active
instrument can be selected using the numeric keypad keys so that the Num Lock
key activates instrument 1, the divide key activates instrument 2 and so on.
The previous or the next instrument can be activated also by pressing the
Control key and the left or right cursor keys, respectively, at the same time.
The active instrument can be edited using the Instrument Properties window
which can be opened using the Properties button in the top right part of
the main window.
</p>

<h3><a id="editing">Editing</a></h3>

<p>
Notes can be played and entered using the keyboard. The keyboard is divided
into two octaves. The keys ZSXDCVGBHNJM represent the notes of the lower one of
the two octaves and the keys Q2W3ER5T6Y7U represent the upper one. The octaves
in question can be selected using the function keys or by using the Keyboard
Octaves selector in the main window. The notes will be played using the
currently active instrument.
</p>

<h4>Cursor</h4>

<p>
The current block is shown in the main part of the main window. The cursor
marks the spot being edited. The cursor keys can be used to move the cursor
around in a block. The line on which the cursor is highlighted. On each track
there are six possible cursor positions: the note position, the instrument
position, two command positions and two command value positions.
</p>

<h4>Note, instrument and command positions</h4>

<p>
When the cursor is in a note position the keyboard can be used to play notes
using the current instrument. If the Edit checkbox is marked the note played is
also placed in the current cursor position and the cursor is moved downwards
the number of lines selected using the Space selector in the main window. The
Edit checkbox can be checked and unchecked using the Space key.
</p>

<p>
When the cursor is in an instrument position the keyboard keys 0-9 and A-Z can
be used to select the instrument using which the note in the note position will
be played.
</p>

<p>
When the cursor is in an command or command value position the keyboard keys
0-9 and A-F can be used to enter the command to be used in the particular line
and track of the block.
</p>

<h3><a id="commands">Commands</a></h3>

<p>
Commands control things like volume, aftertouch, pitch bending and delays of
notes on the track they are placed on. Some commands, such as the tempo
command, affect the playback regardless of which track they are placed on.
MIDI controllers can also be controlled. Commands are placed on tracks on the
right side of the notes.
</p>

<p>
Commands consist of two byte-sized integers in hexadecimal
representation. The first byte (integer) is the command number. The second byte
(integer) is the value to be given to the command. Command numbers 00-7F are
reserved for Tutka's commands; command numbers 80-FF represent MIDI controllers
0-127 so that MIDI controller number is the command number minus 80.
</p>

<p>
Most commands (and all MIDI controller commands) have a value range of 00-7F
due to the precision defined in the MIDI protocol. In such commands values
80-FF can be used to slide the value from the last value to the defined value
minus 80 during the line the command is on.
</p>

<p>
Each block can have multiple command pages. This allows multiple commands to
be placed on the same line on the same track. The active command page is shown
on the lower right corner of the main window. The next command page can be
activated by pressing the Control key and the Tab key simultaneously. The number
of command pages in a block can be changed using the Block List window.
</p>

<h3><a id="playingsequence">Playing sequence</a></h3>

<p>
The playing sequence is used to define in which order the blocks are to be
played. The same block can be played many times or may not be played at all if
it is used for testing or editing purposes. The playing sequence can be edited
using the Playing Sequence window which can be opened by clicking the
Playing Sequence button in the bottom middle part of the main window.
</p>

<h4>Sections</h4>

<p>
For defining the structure of the song even more the song can be constructed
from multiple playing sequences that can be played in any order. Playing
sequences can be created using the Playing Sequence window and can then be
placed in the section list for determining their playing order. The
section list can be considered to be the playing sequence of playing sequences.
The section list can be edited using the Section List window which can be
opened using the Section List button in the bottom left part of the main
window.
</p>

interface, MIDI channel, volume, transpose and hold of the current instrument.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The <b>MIDI interface</b> combo box shows all available MIDI interfaces and an
option for no output.
</li>
<li>
<b>MIDI channel</b> is the MIDI channel to use (on the selected MIDI interface)
from 1 to 16.
</li>
<li>
<b>Volume</b> is the default volume (velocity) of the instrument from 0 to 127.
</li>
<li>
<b>Transpose</b> is the number of halfnotes to transpose the instrument when 
played. Valid range is from -24 (two octaves down) to 24 (two octaves up).
</li>
<li>
<b>Hold</b> defines the default hold value for the instrument - the amount of
ticks until the played note is stopped. Valid range is from 0 to 255. If the
hold value is 0 the note will not be stopped until another note is played on
the same track or playing is stopped.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Open file</h4>

<p>
The Open file dialog can be used to load a Tutka XML file or an MMD song.
</p>

<h4>Save as</h4>

<p>
The Save as dialog can be used to save the current song as a Tutka XML file,
as an MMD song or as an SMF (MIDI) file. The file format depends on the file
extension: <code>.med</code>, <code>.mmd</code> and <code>.mmd2</code> save as
an MMD file, <code>.mid</code> saves as an SMF file and other extensions save
in Tutka format.
</p>

<h4>Transpose</h4>

<p>
The Transpose dialog can be used to transpose a part of the song. The area to
transpose can be entire song, current block, current track or selection. You
can select whether to transpose all instrument in the area or just the current
instrument. The notes can be tranposed octave up, octave down, halfnote up or
halfnote down.
</p>

<h4>Expand/shrink</h4>

<p>
The Expand/Shrink dialog can be used to expand or shrink a part of the song.
Expanding means adding empty lines between existing lines. Shrinking means
removing lines between lines. Expand/Shrink does NOT change the length of the
block so before expanding make sure that there is enough space for all notes to
fit. The area to expand/shrink can be entire song, current block, current track
or selection. You can select how many lines to add between each line (expand)
or how many lines two delete after each line (shrink).
</p>

<h4>Change instrument</h4>

<p>
The Change instrument dialog can be used to change an instrument to another in 
a part of the song. The area for changing instruments on can be entire song,
current block, current track or selection. <b>From</b> and <b>To</b> fields are
used to select the instrument number to change and the instrument number to
change to. You can also swap instruments instead changing using the <b>Swap</b>
button.
</p>

<h4>Track volumes</h4>

<p>
The Track volumes dialog is used to set the default volume of each track. All
volumes are from 0 to 127. Tracks can also be muted: muted tracks are not
played. Tracks can also be soloed. If tracks are soloed the tracks that are
not soloed are not played. Descriptive names can also be added to tracks.
</p>

<p>
Note that the number of tracks displayed in the track volumes dialog is the
maximum number of tracks in the current song. If the maximum number of tracks
in the current song decreases tracks are removed from the Track volumes dialog
and their names are lost.
</p>

<h4>Song properties</h4>

<p>
The Song properties dialog is used to set the name and tempo of the current
song. The <b>Tempo</b> slider sets the tempo of the song in beats per minute.
The <b>Ticks per line</b> slider sets how many MIDI ticks each tracker line
represents. In MIDI a quarter (1/4) note is 24 ticks long, so the default
value, 6 ticks, means that each line represents a 1/16 note.
</p>

<h4>Message list</h4>

<p>
The Message list dialog allows you to create, delete, send, receive, load and
save MIDI messages, set their names and lengths and determine whether they
should be automatically sent after loading. Before MIDI messages can be sent,
received, loaded or saved or before their properties can be changed they must
be created.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
To select a MIDI message for editing click on the row that contains information
about the MIDI message.
</li>
<li>
To insert a new MIDI message before the currently selected message click the
<b>Insert New</b> button.
</li>
<li>
To append a new MIDI message after all messages click the <b>Append New</b>
button.
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
To send the currently selected MIDI message click the <b>Send</b> button.
</li>
<li>
To receive a MIDI message from a MIDI interface as the currently selected
message click the <b>Receive</b> button to open the Receive MIDI message
dialog.
</li>
<li>
To load a raw MIDI message from disk as the currently selected message click
the <b>Load</b> button to open the Load message dialog.
</li>
<li>
To save the currently selected message to a file as a raw MIDI message click
the <b>Save</b> button to open the Save message dialog.
</li>
<li>
To change the name of the current message click on the <b>Name</b> cell of the
message list row that contains information about the message. The cell will
change into a text entry field so you can edit the name. Press Enter when you
are done.
</li>
<li>
To change the length of the current message click on the <b>Length</b> cell of
the message list row that contains information about the message. The cell will
change into a numeric entry field so you can edit the length. Press Enter when
you are done.
</li>
<li>
To define that the current message should be automatically sent after loading
the song click on the checkbox in the <b>Automatically send message after
loading</b> cell of the message list row that contains information about the
message.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Load message</h4>

<p>
The Load message dialog can be used to load a raw MIDI message from a file as
the currently selected message.
</p>

<h4>Save message</h4>

<p>
The Save message dialog can be used to save the currently selected message to
a file as a raw MIDI message.
</p>

<h4>Receive MIDI message</h4>

<p>
This dialog allows you to receive a MIDI message to the currently selected
message.
</p>

<p>
The <b>MIDI interface</b> combo box shows all MIDI interfaces that are
enabled for input in the preferences. At least one MIDI interface must be
enabled for input to receive a MIDI message.
</p>

<p>
Receiving can be started using the <b>Receive</b> button.
It can be stopped using the <b>Stop</b> button.
</p>

<h4>Preferences</h4>

<p>
The <b>MIDI interfaces list</b> allows you to select which of the available
MIDI interfaces are to be used for input and which for output. If a MIDI
interface is not enabled for output notes sent to it using an instrument that
has the MIDI interface defined are not played. If a MIDI interface is not
enabled for input MIDI messages can not be received through the interface and
the interface is not used for receiving notes.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Scheduling mode</b> is used to control how Tutka schedules the player.
RTC is currently the most accurate method but may require the system
administrator to give the user rights to use at least a 512 Hz RTC timer by
running <code>sysctl dev.rtc.max-user-freq to 512</code>. The other option is
Nanosleep which is not very accurate.
</p>

<p>
If RTC timing is selected Tutka tries to use a 2048 Hz timer if available. If
it fails it tries 1024 Hz and 512 Hz and if neither of those are available it
falls back to the Nanosleep method. Another thing worth noting is that
even a 2048 Hz timer is not precise enough so Tutka busy loops until the very
exact moment. This causes a slight CPU load while Tutka is playing.
</p>

<p>
Elevated privileges and priorities can enhance timing accuracy.
</p>

<h4>About</h4>

<p>
This dialog displays information about the version of Tutka you are running.
</p>

<h4>Quit</h4>

<p>
This dialog allows you to quit Tutka by clicking on Quit. Click Cancel to
cancel.

<h3><a id="stepbystep">Step by step</a></h3>

<p>
This is a step by step guide for writing a song using Tutka.
</p>

<h4>MIDI setup</h4>

<p>
The first thing to do is to set up the MIDI devices to be used correctly. This
involves changing the settings of the MIDI devices. Each MIDI instrument that
is going to be used should be assigned an unique MIDI channel. After this the
Tutka instruments should be edited so that they reflect the selected MIDI
instruments. An appropriate MIDI channel should be chosen for each Tutka
instrument so that all MIDI instruments can be played using different Tutka
instruments.
</p>

<p>
If the MIDI devices are not able to store the selected MIDI instrument setup
they can probably send the setup using SysEx. Tutka can receive such SysEx
messages and they can be sent back to the devices to restore the setup.
This can be achieved using the Message List window.
</p>

<h4>Setting up tempo</h4>

<p>
After the setup is done, composing can begin. One of the first things to do is
to choose a tempo for the song. This can be done using the Song Properties
window. The tempo is defined in beats per minute. In addition to this it's
possible to choose how many MIDI ticks each line in the tracker represents.
If the song is not going to have shorter than 1/16 notes in it, the default
value, 6, is usually appropriate. If, for example, 1/32 notes are needed,
the Ticks per line value can be changed to 3 for more fine grained control.
</p>

<h4>Setting up tracks</h4>

<p>
The number of tracks can be chosen for each block separately. It's usually
good, however, to dedicate tracks for different purposes so that they're used
consistently throughout the whole song. It should also be kept in mind that
each track can play only one note at a time. This means thinking of the track
structure a bit. For example, one could allocate track 1 to be used for the
bass drum, track 2 for the snare drum and track 3 for the hi-hats. This way
the different drums can always be found from the same track regardless of
which block is being edited. This also allows naming the tracks appropriately
in the Track Volumes window.
</p>

<h4>Writing blocks</h4>

<p>
Tracker songs are usually composed one block at a time. Each block represents
a part of the song. The length one each block can be chosen to suit the needs.
It's usually convenient to keep the blocks relatively short so that if the
same block is to be repeated, it can be reused without having to create an
another block with almost the same content. After choosing an appropriate
length, notes and related commands can be entered in the block. The block
can be played back and edited until it's satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
When one block is ready, an another one can be created. The new block can
continue from where the previous one left off or can be a completely separate
block. The order in which the blocks are made does not have to correspond to
the order in which they're going to be played back in the final song, so
there no reason not to create blocks for the main ideas of the song first
before going into details and parts in between.
</p>

<h4>Setting the playback order</h4>

<p>
When an appropriate number of parts of the song have been written into blocks
it's time to choose the order in which the blocks are played back when the
entire song is played. This is done by creating a playing sequence using the
Playing Sequence window, which can be opened by clicking on the Position
label on the bottom of the main window. When the entire song is played back
the blocks are played back in the order defined in the playing sequence.
The same block can be played back multiple times.
</p>

<h4>Structuring the song</h4>

<p>
Sometimes it's feasible to play longer parts of the song, consisting of
multiple blocks, multiple times. To avoid having to define these block
sequences multiple times in the playing sequence, several playing
sequences can be defined. For example, a song could have an intro, a
verse and a chorus, of which the verse and the chorus are repeated
twice. Each of these three parts can be defined as a separate playing
sequence using the Playing Sequence List window and then the playing
order of these playing sequences can be defined using the Section List
window.
